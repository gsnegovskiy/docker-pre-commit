# Pre-commit Docker image
[Pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) is a tool created by Yelp that allows you to run pre-commit sanity checks against your repo, to do things like ensuring private keys aren't being added etc. This image packages `pre-commit` in a docker-container, so you can ship it with a setup script you might be using to setup local development environment.

# Usage
- Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your repo. For example

  ```yaml
  - repo: git://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    sha: master  # Use the ref you want to point at
    hooks:
      - { id: check-case-conflict }
      - { id: check-merge-conflict }
      - { id: check-symlinks }
      - { id: check-json }
      - { id: check-yaml }
      - { id: detect-private-key }
      - { id: end-of-file-fixer }
      - { id: trailing-whitespace }
  ```
- Add `pre-commit` script to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
  ```shell
  cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

  NAME=$(basename `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)_precommit
  docker ps -a | grep $NAME &> /dev/null
  CONTAINER_EXISTS=$?

  if [[ CONTAINER_EXISTS -eq 0 ]]; then
      docker restart $NAME && docker attach --no-stdin $NAME
  else
      docker run -t -v $(pwd):/pre-commit --name $NAME taghash/pre-commit
  fi

  ```
- Create an empty commit to test
  ```git commit --allow-empty -m "Test pre-commit"```

# Note
- If you are going to use a `pre-commit` plugin that needs dependencies not packaged in this image, you can extend this image and install the dependencies you need
- You might need to change the command, add volumes etc, based on your needs.
  For example, if you add `{ id: detect-aws-credentials }` to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, you have to mount the directory holding your aws credentials.
  The docker command (as in the `pre-commit` script) would then become
  ```shell
  docker run -t -v $(pwd):/pre-commit -v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws:ro --name $NAME taghash/pre-commit
  ```
